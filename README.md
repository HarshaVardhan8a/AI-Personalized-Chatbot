This is a basic chatbot created using Python.

It gives replies based on the keywords in the user's message.  
It uses if-else conditions and pattern matching (like "hello", "bye", etc.).

I also added features like:
- Telling jokes
- Telling time and date
- Giving motivational quotes
- Logging the chat in a text file

This project helped me understand how rule-based chat systems work.
